## Introduction

C++ is a powerful general-purpose programming language that is widely used for system/software development and game programming, as well as in real-time simulations. This repository will guide you through the fundamental concepts, syntax, and functionalities of C++ with practical examples and exercises.

## Setup and Installation

To get started with C++, you'll need to set up your development environment. Here's a quick guide to get you started:

1. **Install a C++ Compiler**: You can use GCC, Clang, or MSVC.
   - For Windows: [MinGW-w64](http://www.mingw.org/) or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
   - For macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools (install via `xcode-select --install`)
   - For Linux: GCC (install via your package manager, e.g., `sudo apt-get install g++`)

2. **Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**:
   - Visual Studio Code
   - CLion
   - Code::Blocks
   - Eclipse

3. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cpp-concepts-from-scratch.git
   cd cpp-concepts-from-scratch
